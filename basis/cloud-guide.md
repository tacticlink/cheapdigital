## Which Cloud Shall I Choose?

[English Home](https://github.com/tacticlink/cheapdigital/blob/master/README_en.md)

The cloud become a big business, the cloud vendors give their products different terms, we will maintain the simplicty in order to keep our solution low priced, we will use cloud server only, to install Ubuntu Linux on it, then we will install docker up on Ubuntu Linux,then pull odoo image, finally we will run odoo container to launch the application. 

### Price Matters

Even the cloud server name differ, the underlying component is the same, we need Ubuntu Linux, we only need to pay bill according our choice. We will go with which offer best price. 

Actually, cloud service let us pay we use,they will slice the service from one unit to as much as you use, assume we use Odoo 11, require 2GB RAM with one vCPU minimum for 20 Users, we compare the price according this, cloud service provide many more metrics, such as drive size, input output per month,but only RAM matter to application performance.So compare price, we only need to compare with the same RAM size.  

### Mainsteam Vendor Matters

Mainsream Cloud Vendors always mean their are big in size, they survive in initial copetitions, suppose they will be exist long. That is all we can do, although there will be a migration time to move our services to another cloud vendor, in case they are cease their services.

We select mainstream Cloud Vendors. Amozon Web Service(AWS), Google Cloud, Digitalocean, Linode, you can compare what they offer.
