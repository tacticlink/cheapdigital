## Why we go Cloud

[English Home](https://github.com/tacticlink/cheapdigital/blob/master/README_en.md)

To better understand cloud,we have to go to last generation to see what happen there and see the history their envolution.

#### What is Cloud

Before Cloud, if a company want to build software applications they have to build by their own, there is hosting server exist, for website hosting, but function very limit, or either build their own server inside their compond or build rheir own datacenter, the former is a kind of pc, only functioned dehind their compond, the later cost a lot of money which can not afforded by many businesses. That is called Client/Server model.

Now Cloud design for moving the datacenter remotely, that is called Cloud, for instance like AWS, there are many forms of Cloud, we only use server for simplicity. And Cloud design for pay as you use, you can choose to use one portion, either way you can choose to use 10 portions, the computing resources slice as much as you like, that means computing resources are commercialized, to compare with the last generation, you buy exectly you want use, that significantly reduce the cost.

#### Why we have to adopt Cloud

There are few reasons you have to choose Cloud, neither concern you like or dislike.

1. The Cloud vender invest big money. They want to make Cloud as a infrastructure like electricity and water, you have to be in.
2. Your competitor force you to choose. The strong competition force you to adopt Cloud, maybe cloud or internet thing you could not fully understand well, but at the crucial moment, you have no better choice. 

#### Security

You may doubt is your files outside your compond safe? Generally, we treat securities in 2 categories, one stick with cloud vendor, your cloud vendor will deal most security issues for you, for example, you may think how about my server get attacked? That is cloud vendor's business not your business. Another is internal security, most securities flaws come from employers,so those are suggestions:

- your ip address and port number should not share with anyone other than users.
- our solution is based on user access, each user keep his(her) own password.
- the competitiveness of your business has to be based on not commercial secretes but other factors.
